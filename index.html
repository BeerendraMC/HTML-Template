            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web
                pages.
                HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification
                which was published in 1995.
                HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is
                widely used but currently we
                are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
            </p>

                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together.
                        Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up"
                        a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings,
                paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML
                language.
            </p>
            <h2>Basic HTML Document</h2>
            <p>In its simplest form, following is an example of an HTML document âˆ’</p>
            <code>
                <pre class="prettyprint">
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;This is document title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Document content goes here.....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

 &lt;/html&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>
        </div>
    </main>
</body>
